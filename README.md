# Description

The beginnings of a project that analyses various characteristics of a list of trash movies me and my friends have watched over the years.

So far `text_preprocessing.py` has just pre-processed the poorly formatted text file that was stored on our iPhones into a more machine friendly format. 

The `data.py` scripts contains the code that I used to extract the relevant data from `text_preprocessing.py` using the [IMDbPY](https://imdbpy.github.io/) API.
